currently uses array derived from services excel sheet, and uses a hardcoded dummy postcode. url needs state preceding it or the api
misinterprets it. distance is calculated as the crow flies which could be improved by using a different api that calculates driving distance 
between two points.

i tested the sorted list and distances by using my postcode and checking with google maps.
